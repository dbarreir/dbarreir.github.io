            <h3>Checklist for <a href="https://webpages.charlotte.edu/mashton1/itis3135/project/" target="_blank">Bridge To Abilities</a></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There seems to be no uppercase or spaces on the links.</li>
                <li>Design:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Across all pages the h3 has contrast problems, whether it's pink over blue or pink over pink.</li>
                        <li>There color and fonts seems to be standard across all pages.</li>
                        <li>CRAP:
                            <ul>
                                <li>There are some contrast problems between pink and blue, I would suggest to use blue boxes on the main page too since the other pages are all blue boxes, no in-between.</li>
                                <li>There seems to be used the same styling across all pages, nothing stands out too much except the main page</li>
                                <li>The alignment seems the same overall but on the main page there are four boxes with bad alignment at the end</li>
                                <li>It all seems to be grouped by section correctly</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>It has header + main + footer, footer is a component but header is not a component on itself, the nav inside the header is the component.</li>
                <li>Header has h1 with the name of the brand</li>
                <li>Main starts with an h2</li>
                <li>Footer has validation links, but I don't think the links on the footer are necessary for the client project.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Other notes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>On footer there seems to be two styles for the links, one white and another blue, since there's white text already maybe make all links blue on the footer, also there's an underline between the images.</li>
                <li>The images on the footer don't redirect correctly, check the script to put it inside the footer component and after the images so it works correctly.</li>
            </ul>

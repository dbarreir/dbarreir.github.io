                <li>Contrast: The page has doubtful contrasts over all the page, for example there's an orange box with black text</li>
                <li>Repetition: There's no constant in the page, every part of it it's different and it stands out on it's own</li>
                <li>Alignment: The page doesn't seem to have a defined alignment, there's a yellow container that seems to hold the page and some divs overflow from it</li>
                <li>Proximitiy: Even if it seems to be grouped well, the way it's done makes it hard to be sure of it</li>

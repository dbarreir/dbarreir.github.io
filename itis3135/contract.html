        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <div class="box-text">
            <p>I, Diana Barreiro Gonsalve agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SPRING 2025, ITIS 3135 , Web-Based Application Design and Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</p>
            <p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates' code directly.</p>
            <p>I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.</p>
            <p>Signed: Diana Barreiro Gonsalve, 27/01/2025</p>
